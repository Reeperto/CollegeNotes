# Review of Fernando's Essay

Fernando's AP takes on the form of an academic paper, contrasting his more letter like CP. He roots the crux of his argument into what he focused on his CP: his Filipino heritage and discussing parallelisms between the politics of the Philippines and the American prison system. Importantly, he uses the previous discussion between scholars in that context to pivot to a discussion of solving mass incarceration, and specifically due to the opioid epidemic.

- The paper does a great job of establishing itself as a proper successor the CP while still being focused on solutions of mass incarceration and the steps that can be taken towards abolition. It becomes more and more of an academic paper as it goes on, making it feel like a natural gradient between the formal letter of the CP and the academic and precise AP.
- It is not immediately clear as to what the goal of the paper in the beginning but becomes more evident as it goes on. I think it would be useful if the paper laid out in a more clear and direct manner in the introduction of where it will start (a.k.a. the ending of the CP) and what direction it will take those ideas in. This will make reading through the first half of the paper a lot easier and improve overall flow.
- The incorporation of evidence is great and everything has an associated source, really strengthening the positions the paper is laying out. I will say that the ideas being presented could be even stronger if the commentary/analysis was modified. Often the analysis would be muddied by very long comma separated sentences that would be hard to follow. Just like the use of evidence in the paper, make your analysis and commentary more direct and don't be afraid to use simpler sentences if it serves to make the point more potent.

# Reflection

The feedback Andy and I received for our Zines was mostly positive. The only major feedback we got to act on is to take what we had planned out and fully execute on it. Neither of the zines are fully completed yet so we are going to work to have both done alongside other creative extras if time allows. The following are changes Andy and I intend to incorporate as we continue:

- Instead of an academic abstract, we will look at the possibility of creating a paragraph "publishing pitch". That is, some quick blurb with the intent of trying to convince say a real publishing company for funding to produce a run of the zines we are making.
- Create supplementary stickers that pertain to a specific section of a zine. These theoretically could be packaged with the zines if they were actually published/printed.
- Potentially limit the scope of the zines. Currently they are concerned with a more comprehensive overlook of the arguments for abolition and then 3 major alternatives to prisons. It may be more advantageous to have more specificity. On the flip side it may be more fitting in a handout zine to address more issues, just potentially less in depth.

Overall we need to first finish the zines then we will focus on potential supplementary material to create a potentially real collection.
