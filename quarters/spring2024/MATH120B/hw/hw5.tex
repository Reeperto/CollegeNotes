The rings cannot be isomorphic since $2 \Z / 8 \Z$ doesn't have unity but $\Z_4$ does.

\subsection*{26.9}
Let $\phi : \Z \to \Z \times \Z : n \mapsto (n, 0)$. $\phi$ is a homormorphism, however the unity of $\Z$ is $1$ and $\phi(1) = (1, 0)$ which is not the unity of $\Z \times \Z$.

\subsection*{26.12}
The factor ring $\Z / 2 \Z$ is a field since $\Z / 2 \Z$ is isomorphic to $\Z_2$ which is a field.

\subsection*{26.13}
The factor ring $\Z / 6 \Z$ is isomorphic to $\Z_6$ which has the zero divisor $3$.

\subsection*{26.14}
In $\Z \times \Z$, $(1,0)(0,1) = 0$ meaning it has zero divisors, however the factor ring $(\Z \times \Z) / (\Z \times \qty{0})$ is isomorphic to $\Z$ which has no zero divisors.

\subsection*{26.15}
The subring $\qty{(n, n) : n \in \Z}$ is a subring, however $(a,b)(n,n) = (an, bn)$ will not be an element in the subring if $a \neq b$.

\subsection*{26.18}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\phi : F \to R$ be a ring homorphism and $N = \ker \phi$. Assume that $N \neq \qty{0}$. Then there is some element $a \in F$ and $a \in N$. Since $F$ is a field, $a$ is a unit, meaning $a^{-1} \in F$. Since $N$ is also an ideal, then $a^{-1} a \in N$ meaning $N$ contains unity. Therefore $x 1 = x \in N$ for all $x \in F$, hence $N = F$. Therefore every element of $F$ is mapped to $0$. If $N = \qty{0}$, then $\phi$ must be one-to-one.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{26.20}
\begin{proof}
    By the binomial theorem,
    \[
        (a+b)^p = \sum_{n=0}^p \binom{p}{n} a^{n} b^{p-n}
    .\]
    Since $p$ is prime, the coefficients $\binom{p}{n}$ for $1 \leq n \leq p - 1$ will all be multiples of $p$. Since $R$ is of characteristic $p$, these terms all will go to zero. Therefore for any $a,b \in R$, it follows $(a+b)^p = a^p + b^p$. Therefore 
    \[
        \phi_p(a+b) = (a+b)^p = a^p + b^p = \phi_p(a) + \phi_p(b)
    .\]
    Trivially $\phi_p(ab) = (ab)^p = a^p b^p = \phi_p(a) \phi_p(b)$. Therefore $\phi_p$ is a ring homomorphism.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{26.22}
\subsubsection*{Part A}
\begin{proof}
    Since an ideal is also a subring, then $\phi[N]$ is a subring of $R'$. Let $r \in R$ and $n \in N$. Since $N$ is an ideal, then $rn \in N$ and $nr \in N$. Since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism
    \begin{align*}
        \phi(r) \phi(n) &= \phi(rn) \in \phi[N] \\
        \phi(n) \phi(r) &= \phi(nr) \in \phi[N]
    \end{align*}
    Therefore $\phi[N]$ is an ideal of $\phi[R]$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Part B}
Take $\phi : \Z \to \Q : x \mapsto x$ and the ideal $3 \Z$ of $\Z$. Since 
\[
    \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3 = 1
\]
then if $3 \Z$ was an ideal of $\Q$, it would have to contain unity but it does not. So $3 \Z$ is an ideal of $\Z$ but $\phi[3 \Z]$ is not an ideal of $\Q$.

\subsubsection*{Part C}
\begin{proof}
    Note that $N'$ is a subring of $R$. Let $r \in R$ and $n \in \phi^{-1}[N']$. That is $\phi(n) \in N'$. Then $\phi(rn) = \phi(r) \phi(n)$. Since $N'$ is an ideal of $\phi[R]$ or $R'$, then $\phi(r) \phi(n) \in N'$ and the same argument shows $\phi(nr) \in N'$. Therefore $\phi^{-1}[N']$ is an ideal of $R$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{26.26}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x,y \in I_a$. Then $ax = 0$ and $ay = 0$. Note that then
    \[
        ax + ay = 0 \implies a(x + y) = 0
    .\]
    Therefore $x + y \in I_a$. Since $a0 = 0$, $I_a$ contains the additive identity. Furthermore, $a(-x) = -(ax) = 0$, therefore $I_a$ contains additive inverses. Let $r \in R$. Note that $rax = r 0 = 0$ and $axr = 0 r = 0$ meaning $rI_a \subseteq I_a$ and $I_a r \subseteq I_a$. Therefore $I_a$ is an ideal of $R$.
\end{proof}
