# Utility Revisited

A core assumption of modern decision theory is that

\begin{center}
    rational agents **maximize utility**
\end{center}

This is a very descriptive account of people's wants and preferences. That is, it is characterizing the way we value our wants, not prescribing what one ought to want. Utility functions appear inadequate to capture all preferences, and there are preferences we have that we feel are wrong. This requires having a normative aspect.

## Normativity in Wants

What *should* we want, and *why*?

- It is ethically or morally required
- God has dictated it so
- Will lead to obtaining a want
- The want has intrinsic or objective value
