# The Constitution - Dworkin

## Judicial Review $\implies$ Examining the "constitutionality" of law and uphold/strike laws on such a basis

- Established in Marbury v. Madison
    - While the court didn't apply Judicial Review for the case, Judge Marshall asserted the power of Judicial Review as real
- Could it be a power grab by Marshall?
    - The Constitution in Art. VI and Art. III do define some scope of judicial power
    - The conception of the Court is to interpret and apply the law, so Judicial Review does adhere to the role the judiciary branch plays
    - At this point, no argument can be really made against it due to the vast history backing it

## Constitutions are special

- Our constitution establishes 3 main things
    - Protection of individual rights
    - Constitutionally limited democracy (which protects against...)
    - **Tyranny of the Majority**
        - Prevent simple majorities from revoking the rights of legislative minorities
        - Ex. Nazi march in a Jewish community cannot be made illegal
- The constitution is special in this way as it puts limitations on legislative majorities to protect individuals and legislative minorities
- All of this a promise from the government to individuals/citizens
- _Side Note_: Liberal Democracy $\implies$ A tradition of government that is structured by the governed body and generally protects individuals. A.K.A. a democracy where everyone agrees to a government structure.
- The constitution turns democracy into a constitutionally limited democracy

## How would Hercules interpret the Constitution?

- Hercules will _reject_ Historicism
    - Understanding the constitution through the explicit and concrete intentions of the framers, something inherently conversational
- Hercules will _reject_ passivism
    - Understanding the constitution via the views of a democratic majority
        - The constitution's most important feature is a protect from the tyranny of a majority, so such as view violates/subverts the constitution
- The interpretation force of "popular morality" varies based on the demands of justice in cases
    - Commercial/private cases may weigh in popular opinion (Ex. McLaughlin)
    - Constitutional cases will tend to ignore popular/majority opinion (Ex. Brown)
- Rejection of Historicism and Passivism does ***not*** make Hercules/judges judicial activists
    - Judges will still see themselves as interpreting the constitution, just in differing and potentially controversial ways
    - The question to ask is if a judge's _strategy of interpretation_ is defensible
    - Hercules ask not whether to interpret or apply constitutional grantees, but how to do so

## "Due Process" in the Constitution

- "Due process of law" has **no** plain meaning
    - Even attempts to use the intentions/history backing the amendments does not further an interpretation of the due process clause
- A potential interpretation: Procedural Due Process
    - Deprivation of life, liberty, or property must be done so via democratic means/legislation
    - Almost no constraints on the substance of what the laws say, just focuses on the procedure
    - The constraint is **Rational Basis Review**
        - Legislation must reasonably pursue a legitimate state interest
    - P.D.P. is rejected in Lockner v. New York and is replaced by **Substantive Due Process**
        - S.D.P. puts stronger constraints on the substance or what a statute can actually do
        - Originated from economic conservatives on the Court that believed economic liberties deserved higher protections (Economic Substantive Due Process)
            - Ex. Liberty of contract in Lockner v. New York $\implies$ Cannot put restrictions on contracts as it is "unfair"
        - From Lockner, if the state limits a _fundamental right_, it must be for a compelling state interest and in the least restrictive manner possible (*strict scrutiny*)
        - Non-fundamental rights only have to pass rational basis review
- An important note on terminology
    - Interests
        - **Compelling Interest** $\implies$ An interest that is important towards the health, safety, or well-being of your citizens
        - **Legitimate Interest** $\implies$ A credible want by the state
    - Manner
        - **Least Restrictive Manner** $\implies$ The method must be as minimal in scope and effect to accomplish the state's interest
        - **Reasonable** $\implies$ The method is not self-defeating or bat-shit insane

## What are "fundamental" liberties?

- Economic Substantive Due Process said that economic liberties were fundamental, something considered as an embarrassment and failure of the judicial system
- Courts then said *civil rights* are the correct pool of rights to determine what is fundamental
    - Complicated by selected incorporation: not all rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are fundamental, and some rights that aren't enumerated are still considered fundamental (Ex. Privacy)
    - Selective incorporation demands a rationale to function, eg. the fundamental liberties must make grantees meaningful
