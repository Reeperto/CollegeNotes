## The Natural Law Tradition

> This law of nature, being coeval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other.  It is binding all over the globe in all countries, and at all times:  no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this, and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. (Blackstone)

## Legal Positivism

## The Separation of Law and Morals

## "The existence of law is one thing, it's merit or demerit is another" (Austin)

## The Command Theory of Law

## Command

## Sovereign

## Habit of Obedience

## Power-conferring Laws

## Nullity as a Sanction

Treating nullity as a sanction is an idea from Command Theorists that attempts to encapsulate conferment of power to individuals under command theory. Issues arise when trying to understand laws that provide facilities for individuals to realize their wishes as the threat associated with not following them is not of the same nature as a criminal law, and hence requires treating the threat of nullity as a sanction. The idea is part of Hart's larger argument against Command Theory as he explains that nullity cannot be properly assimilated into the sanctions associated with criminal law and hence Command Theory fails to encapsulate an entire type of law.

## Who would be the sovereign in a representative democracy and why does this constitute a problem for the Command Theory?

Under Command Theory, the sovereign of a representative democracy would be the citizens themselves. This is a fairly nonsensical notion as the sovereign is intended to be unbounded by other authority, yet the citizens are subject to the law. Representative democracy's prove to be another corner case that does not align with the very simple and compelling argument Command Theory intends to make, furthering the fact that Command Theory fails to properly represent real legal systems.

## Rex I and Rex II

Rex I and Rex II are two theoretical absolute monarchs used by Hart where Rex II is the successor of Rex I. Hart uses them to demonstrate another flaw within Command Theory, that being the habit of obedience. Hart argues that under Command Theory, it is not possible to understand how the monarchy's authority would continue after Rex I dies as none of the people have had a historical habit of obeying Rex II. This later becomes an important part of Hart's own proposed theory as he argues that this example demonstrates that alongside laws, there are also rules (in this instance a rule of succession) that represent something stronger than habits, usually backed by social pressure to dissuade deviations.

## Tacit Commands

## The Gunman Worry

As part of Hart's summary of his complaints with Command Theory, he returns to the gunman situation where the gunman says to a victim that they must either give the money or be killed. Hart argues that this is an exact representation of what Command Theory lays out except the gunman is addressing a large group of people who are accustomed to this behavior and surrender. It is highly implausible that law is the gunman situation scaled up and order is a simple notion of compulsion.

## The Internal Attitude
## Primary Rules of Obligation

Rules of etiquette
Rules of more
Codes of morality

Problems that arise when only in a system of PRO's. When solved in a specific way, a legal system arises.

- Uncertainty
  - Without a codification or assignment of authority, rules act like a game of pickup where differing people have differing conceptions of the same rough rules. 
  - Solved by a Rule of Recognition
- Dispute Resolution
  - There is no mechanism of resolving any conflicts between people in a consistent manner. A system of just PRO's would lead to situations where the outcome is determined by factors such as who has more status, or who is more physically capable to fight, etc.
  - Solved by a Rule of Adjudication
      - Outlines authoritative procedures on how to resolve disagreements about rules
- Static Character
  - When rule's are set, there is no procedure that would provide an authoritative change to the rules. Therefore there is no avenue for modifying the pre-existing rules and leads to a static set of PRO's
  - Solved by a Rule of Change: some process that allows the change of rules
 
- Secondary Rules

Secondary rules are rules about rules with the purpose of determining what primary rules of obligations are laws and which ones are not. They are a key part of Hart's conception of the law as they are his proposed answer to the question of what separates a rule from a law.

## Problems of Uncertainty/Rule of Recognition
## Problems of Dispute Resolution/Rules of Adjudication
## Problems of Static Character/Rules of Change

Considering a society that is built entirely off of a system of primary rules of obligation, there is no procedure that would enable to modification of any rules and then its subsequent enforcement.

## In Hart's theory, why can't we simply use the Secondary Rules themselves to specify who the officials in a society are?

We cant explain the authoritative legal status of a particular group of secondary rules by appeal to the legal authority of those very rules.

## In Hart's theory, how is the Rule of Recognition for a particular legal system determined?  Explain.

Internal Attitude of Officials

## The Open Texture of Legal Language

Hart's concept of an "open texture" with legal language serves to balance the two extreme theories of adjudication: formalism and realism. Hart recognizes that formalism is an impossibility by the existence of hard cases, but that in many cases the application of law is straightforward unlike what the realists argue. The idea of the "open texture" is that legal language has a generality to it with clear application and then a fringe (what he goes on to call a "penumbra") where its application is unclear. This combines the worlds of formalism and realism as in cases where rules and their language apply clearly, judges role is then to utilize and apply the law in the manner that is outlined. In the cases where judges however "run out of law", they become the judges that legal realists think of in that they then have complete discretion over the decision.

Hard cases are cases where the application of the general terms of the law is not obvious.

## Extra-Legal Grounds

## Judicial Discretion

## A 'Quasi-Legislative Function' for Judges

## Legal Realism/Rule Skepticism - TALKED ABOUT

## Mechanical Jurisprudence - TALKED ABOUT

## "[A]fter all, it is only words that the legislature utters; it is for the courts to say what those words mean; that is, it is for them to interpret legislative acts....And this is the reason why legislative acts, statutes, are to be dealt with as sources of Law, and not as part of the Law itself....It has sometimes been said that the Law is composed of two parts--legislative law and judge-made law--but, in truth, all the Law is judge made law." (Gray)

This argument is part of the foundation of legal realism and skepticism where it appears that the interpretive freedom and flexibility that judges have is almost unlimited to make whatever decision they want. Therefore any formalism of law really is not valid as the conduct of citizens is shaped by the final word of judges.

## "If you want to know the law and nothing else, you must look at it as a bad man, who cares only for the material consequences which such knowledge enables him to predict, not as a good one, who finds his reasons for conduct, whether inside the law or outside of it, in the vaguer sanctions of conscience." (Holmes)

This is a central argument to legal realism/skepticism: those who violate the law are not going to be concerned with the axiomatic foundation of the law, the internal attitudes of citizens, primary and secondary rules, etc. They are only concerned with what the courts actually do. This is an important argument as it directly refutes the basis of Hart's claim that rules and law that have a predictable and straightforward application in court even exist.

## The 'Bad Man's' Point of View

## Scorer's Discretion

Legal realists confuse finality with infallibility. Hart offers an analogy to understand the difference between his conception of law and legal realist's version. Hart claims that his legal system and other formal frameworks are analogous to games like Baseball or Cricket and that legal realism is analogous to the game "Scorers Discretion" where the decisions are determined by the players and not the refs as in Baseball/Cricket.

> Here at the margin of rules and in the fields left open by the theory of precedents, the courts perform a rule-producing functionâ€¦.In England this fact is often obscured by forms:  for the courts often disclaim any such function and insist that the proper task of statutory interpretation and the use of precedent is, respectively, to search for the 'intention of the legislature' and the law that already exists. (Hart)

## Legal Principles

## Riggs v. Palmer (Elmer's inheritance case)

Riggs v. Palmer is an important case in Dworkin's arguemnt against Hart's conception of the legal system. In the court case, a son who know's he is to inherit from his father murders his father to prevent him from changing his will. The court was determining then if it is legal for the son to recieve the inheritance. The eventual decision was not one guided by rules or law in the sense that Hart lays out. Instead, the judges appealed to the principle that no one shall benefit from their own fraud. This principle is not a rule as it is not binary in its application, but instead a general consideration that can be overtaken by others (a concept uncaptured by Hart's rules). Therefore Dworkin believes that Hart's rules concerning adjudication fail fundamentally to capture the real process.

## Explain (using an example) Dworkin's argument that legal principles matter even in what Hart thinks are 'easy' cases.

The legal issue at the core of Riggs v. Palmer was very clear cut. The law pertaining to inheritance clearly stated that the son was entitled to the inheritance. However, even though this would be an "easy case" according to Hart and therefore a simple application of rules, principles still mattered to the judges in the case and actually led to an outcome opposite of what the formalist application of law would give. Therefore even in these "easy cases", principles and intentions still have weight in ajudication, directly going against Hart's theory.

## The Chain Novel

The Chain Novel is a metaphor Dworkin provides to explain the process of constructive interpretation in judicial decision making. A Judge making a decision is like a new author brought on to write a chapter of a novel. They must interpret the previous chapters and make sure that what they do next fits the story, but at the same time trying to extend the novel in the best or most interesting way the judge believes. This process outlines the cycle of judicial decision making Dworkin constructs and further more makes it clear the idea that jduges are constrained in their interpretation, otherwise the chapter they write will be seen as a mistake as it fails to continue the novel's story.

- Consider the question of if those 16 or younger should or should not be subject to the death penalty
    - Under specific intentions, the framers did not outline it as cruel or unusual so therefore they should be subject to it
    - Under abstract intentions, the framers wanted to prevent any future cruel harm by the hands of the government and therefore they shouldnt be subject to it

## Conventionalism

Legal Positivism's method of Constructive Interpretation => No further interpretation is necessary

- The right decision is the one that the judge chooses at their discretion once the text of the law runs out

## Pragmatism

Legal Realism's method of Constructive Interpretation => No further interpretation is necessary

- The right decision is the one that the judge finds most appealing

> Law as integrity is therefore more relentlessly interpretive than either conventionalism or pragmatism.  These latter theories offer themselves as interpretations.  They are conceptions of law that claim to show our legal practices in the best light these can bear, and they recommend, in their postinterpretive conclusions, distinct styles or programs for adjudication.  But the programs they recommend are not themselves programs of interpretation:  they do not ask judges deciding hard cases to carry out any further, essentially interpretive study of legal doctrine.  (Dworkin)
