# The Movie

## What it establishes about Hong Kong

Consider that Hong Kong was released from British Colonial rule the year the film was released. The film does not make any direct allusions to this fact, but rather through the everyday life of the characters is the effects and implications of the future for Hong Kong's youth.

- Church and school have failed the youth
	- Susan Hui's suicide in front of the church
	- Moon dropping out of school at a young age
	- The 'Nice' school boys in their prepped white uniforms are in fact the killers in the film, not Moon

## 'Unmade' (and Remaking) in Hong Kong

There is an argument that the film is a sociological study of how the city breaks forces the young into a deterministic, dead end situation.

However, the idea of undoing and destruction has potential nuance. Rather than simply a sociological analysis of the dismantling of lives for Hong Kong youth, the dismantling is to restructure the societal systems for the better in order to undo the dysfunctionality of day-to-day society.

- Moon and Ping do not choose to contribute to the normality of bullying and beating Sylvester, rather seeking to befriend and protect him
- From the ruins of Moon's misfortunes, he is able to forge a sense of community, love, and arguable heroism from his efforts
	- *Is this enough?* His mother clearly states that she believes he will amount to nothing more than his own father: an unknown bastard

### Susan Hui: The 'Main' Character

Susan commits suicide at the very beginning due to unrequited love from her PE teacher. The rest of the movie she is only ever seen or understood through her presence in Moon's and his friends minds and her letters (she is a spectral figure).

- Her PE teacher after receiving the letter, tears it apart. In both life and death, he rejects her.

- Asymmetry in when the characters come to visit Susan. They run through hills like the children in *The Sound of Music*, but in a twisted way they are surrounded by death and graves. From the ruins or shambles they attempt to rebuild and redefine the world around them.

**Caution**: Is this assertion a valid description of their world or is it rather an imaginary ideal that has no significant impact

Scene's to note:
- Double shock
	- When Moon is assigned to assassinate a business man, the audience is exposed to two shocks. One (imaginary) where he prepares and assassinates the man in cold blood, and the other more crazed (real) scene where he is unable to do so and fails quite disastrously
- Moon at Ping's Grave
	- While Moon is bleeding out at Ping's grave, children play and push him, blissfully or potentially desensitized to the gruesome nature of the situation
