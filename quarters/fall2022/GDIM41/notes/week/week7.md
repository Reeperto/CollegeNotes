	- Range's between if motivation is player or environmental
	- Range's between if receiving agent is other player's or the environment

These degrees of freedom lend themselves to 4 separable quadrants

- Achievers (Environment and Acting On)
- Socialites (Players and Acting With)
- Killers (Players and Acting On)
