title: Games as Narrative Architectures
---

# Henry Jenkins

Had three main arguments:

- **Spatiality** a key means for telling stories in games
- Designers **sculpt spaces** with narrative potential
- Narrative is a **collaborative** accomplishment

## Spatiality

- 

## Collaboration

- Players construct stories from the gameplay, utilizing their literary repertoire of genre knowledge, related or similar narratives, cheats, etc.

Jenkins argues that "the core narrative behind many games center around the struggle to explore, map, and master contested spaces". This means that to many, their personal narrative or stories come from their mastering of the game and not necessarily just from the narrative presented in the game.
