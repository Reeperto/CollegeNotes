abstract="CT colonography (CTC) is a minimally invasive screening technique for colorectal polyps and colon cancer. Since electronic colon cleansing (ECC) cannot completely remove the presence of pseudo-polyps, most CTC protocols acquire both prone and supine images to improve the visualization of the lumen wall and to reduce false positives. Comparisons between the prone and supine images can be facilitated by computerized registration between the scans. In this paper, we develop a fully automatic method for registering colon surfaces extracted from prone and supine images. The algorithm uses shape spectrum to extract the shape characteristics which are employed as the surface signature to find the correspondent regions between the prone and supine lumen surfaces. Our experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 12.6 {\textpm}4.20 mm over 20 datasets. It also shows excellent potential in reducing the false positive when it is used to determine polyps through correspondences between prone and supine images.",

Associated with G, there is an integral quadratic form, Q(x), on the n-tuple of indeterminates x = (x1, …, xn), given by Q(x) = Σ(xi − xj)2, where the sum is taken over all edges (i, j) of G. In this paper we prove that the quadratic forms Q1, Q2 associated with graphs G1, G2 are congruent by a unimodular matrix if and only if G1 and G2 are cycle isomorphic.}

abstract = {A new method for improving polygonizations of implicit surfaces with sharp features is proposed. The method is based on the observation that, given an implicit surface with sharp features, a triangle mesh whose triangles are tangent to the implicit surface at certain inner triangle points gives a better approximation of the implicit surface than the standard marching cubes mesh Lorensen(in our experiments we use VTK marching cubes VTK). First, given an initial triangle mesh, its dual mesh composed of the triangle centroids is considered. Then the dual mesh is modified such that its vertices are placed on the implicit surface and the mesh dual to the modified dual mesh is considered. Finally the vertex positions of that "double dual" mesh are optimized by minimizing a quadratic energy measuring a deviation of the mesh normals from the implicit surface normals computed at the vertices of the modified dual mesh. In order to achieve an accurate approximation of fine surface features, these basic steps are combined with adaptive mesh subdivision and curvature-weighted vertex resampling. The proposed method outperforms approaches based on the mesh evolution paradigm in speed and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The dual of a 2-manifold polygonal mesh without boundary is commonly defined as another mesh with the same topology (genus) but different connectivity (vertex--face incidence), in which faces and vertices occupy complementary locations and the position of each dual vertex is computed as the center of mass (barycenter or centroid) of the vertices that support the corresponding face. This barycenter dual mesh operator is connectivity idempotent but not geometrically idempotent for any choice of vertex positions, other than constants. In this paper we construct a new resampling dual mesh operator that is geometrically idempotent for the largest possible linear subspace of vertex positions. We look at the primal and dual mesh connectivities as irregular sampling spaces and at the rules to determine dual vertex positions as the result of a resampling process that minimizes signal loss. Our formulation, motivated by the duality of Platonic solids, requires the solution of a simple least-squares problem. We introduce a simple and efficient iterative algorithm closely related to Laplacian smoothing and with the same computational cost. We also characterize the configurations of vertex positions where signal loss does and does not occur during dual mesh resampling and the asymptotic behavior of iterative dual mesh resampling in the general case. Finally, we describe the close relation existing with discrete fairing and variational subdivision, and define a new primal--dual interpolatory recursive subdivision scheme.},

In order to compress the mesh geometry information, we generate a fixed spectral basis using the dual graph derived from the mesh topology. After we partition a 3-D mesh model into several independent submeshes to reduce coding complexity, each submesh geometry is projected onto the generated orthonormal basis for the spectral coding. We encode two initial vertices and the dual graph information of the mesh geometry and prove the reversibility between the dual graph and the mesh geometry. The proposed scheme overcomes difficulty of generating a fixed spectral basis, and it provides multi-resolution representation of 3-D mesh models.},
