# Important Terms
- The Sovereign
    - Used by Austin
    - A legal system with a sense of supremacy within it's territory and independence from other legal systems where laws are orders backed by threats
- **Reversal vs Quashing**
    - A reversed court opinion is one where an inferior courts order is determined to be incorrect in what it says about the law by a superior court while a quashed opinion is where an inferior courts order is determined invalid by a superior court because the inferior court did not have jurisdiction

## Rebuttals to Austin
- Examining a situation where a gunman is robbing a bank, the gunman's order of "handing over the notes" would be misleadinly labeled as a command but Austin.
    - A command is not an order backed by a threat, but rather an order positioned from a level or respect of authority
    - Fundamentally, deriving law from commands is flawed because of its dependence on constructs of authority which procludes the easy construction an axiomatic version of law
- An order backed by a threat leads to penal model that fails to encapsulate all types of law
- Even if Austin's notion of the *Sovereign* resolves the issues of content, mode of origin, and range of application, the model still fails to be useful as it does not correspond to or reflect any real legal system
- There exist forms of laws that do not dictate actions but provide 'facilities' and/or methods for the realization of indiviuals wishes. These such laws do not fit within the 'orders backed by threats' model of Austin
    - Treating law simply as threat backed orders robs individuals of defining their legal relationship to others (such as in the form of contracts, wills, marriage, etc)
- The idea of obeying or disobeying a law breaks down in certain laws that provision how something is carried out, such as a majority vote required to pass a law. Those who vote in favor are not necessarily obeying the law and those who dont disobeying.
    - (QUESTION): Isn't this technically still obeying a law? This is more discussing that a law must be passed by majority and isn't necessairly imposing a manner by which they should vote. Legislators will still obey the rule that if a majority is achieved, the law is passed.


## Agreements with Austin
- Austin is correct in noting that the 'general habit of obediance' is a vague and imprecise notion

## Other Notions
- The legal system of a state has a sense of supremacy scoped to its territory and an independence from other state legal systems
- Court officials are bestowed the legal ability to serve orders and opinions in any manner they want. However, if it does not comply with the law that determines what is in their jurisdiction, it is able to be quashed.
    - Importantly, it is not quashed immediately. It has the potential to be quashed but is not until a superior court does so
    - An 'incorrect' order is not inherently wrong, but the process of ordering the incorrect order is what is wrong. Ordering an out of jurisdiction order is something that the judge is not legally empowered to do.
