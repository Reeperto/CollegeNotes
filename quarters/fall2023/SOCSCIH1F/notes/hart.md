# Harts `The Concept of Law`

## Hart's Objections to Command Theory

- Content of Laws
    - Power Conferring laws and 'nullity as a sanction'
- Scope of Laws
    - Laws that bind the sovereign
- Origin of Laws
    - Common law
- Continuity of Authority
    - Rex I and Rex II
- Persistence of Law
- Limits on Legislative Power

In general, all of these are motivated by the fact that Command Theory cannot account for the concept of a "rule"

## Hart's Conception of Law: The Union of Primary and Secondary Rules

- Hart agrees with the foundation of Command Theory: Legal Positivism
- Hart disagrees that a command encapsulates all of law
- Law must be described by both commands and *rules*

Limits of legislative power:

In the case of Rex, if he were to have a habitual obedience to letter sent by another leader, his proclamations over his land are still law even if he is in a habitual obedience to some other entity. This is not accounted for in the Command Theory as Rex would not be a sovereign under its interpretation.

## Rules

- Rules require the conception of citizen's internal attitude towards the law
- Rules are normative, aka something backed by social acceptance and not purely habitual compliance to authority

But fundamentally, what makes a rule a law?

Hart imagines a society where everything is determined by primary rules of obligation. In this conception, none of the rules are laws. As a consequence, Hart says three problems arise. However by solving each one in a specific manner, Hart argues that the conception of law and a legal system arises. The three problems that arise are:

- Uncertainty
- Dispute Resolution
- Static Character

Consider a game of pickup for a sport. When people get together to play, they all may have differing ideas of what rules to play by and there is a high chance that people will not be in agreement. This outlines the problem of uncertainty. This theoretical system does not have a central truth about what the rules are. Hart provides that the solution to this is a rule of recognition.

The proposed solutions to each problem Hart gives are each examples of what he calls **Secondary Rules**. Secondary Rules are rules that are concerned with other rules. They are the determining factor of whether a primary rule of obligation is a law or not. Importantly, Hart argues that the process of generating secondary rules out of problems that arise is what identifies a legal system.

A problem arises for secondary rules in this current form: how are the secondary rules determined and who determines them? A secondary rule is unable to specify the officials in a society itself because the authoritative legal status of secondary rules cannot be explained by appealing to the legal authority of same rules. Therefore Hart claims that the officials are those that who society defer to when there are questions about what the rules and legal system are. This is the idea of an internal attitude of officials. 

And the officials of a society come from patterns of deference in a society. The reasoning as to *why* people in a society would defer to them is, to Hart, not relevant to the theory.

Consider an alternative explanation: secondary rules are instead satisfying another set of rules and that is what gives them legal authority. However, this obviously turns into the exact same problem as secondary rules in that there is an appeal to the legal authority of the very same rules.

## Maintenance of Legal Positivism

In Harts theory, he argues that by basing it in empirical facts and terms independent of morals instead of metaphysics and morals that he maintains the important idea of Legal Positivism.

## Hart's Defense of His Theory

### Legal Realism

- Early 20th century school of thought
    - Most famously defended by famous Supreme Court Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes
- Opposition of "formalism" or "mechanical jurisprudence" as a view of *judicial decision making*
    - Formalism/Mechanical Jurisprudence claims that since laws dictate their application to cases, therefore judicial decisions are a straightforward exercise
    - Legal Realists are skeptical of the existence of straight forward, automatic, and exception less applicable legal rules. They insist that legal rules no matter what require some level of discretion or judgement by a judge when considering their application.

This school of thought popped up in a famous court case that Holmes was a part of. In it, a man stole an airplane and took it across state lines. A law stipulated that stealing a motor vehicle and taking it across state lines was illegal. So the question was if an airplane is a 'motor vehicle' as the airplane didn't exist when the rule was created.

From this, Holmes drew a startling moral that we can understand what law is from by saying to look at law from the "bad man's point of view".

**The Bad Man's Point of View**
- Only a concern for material consequences
- The law to the bad man is not based on a axiomatic foundation or a derivation from principles or ethics. The bad man only cares about how the courts in say Massachusetts or England act to inform what he can or can't get away with

### Hart's Tort

One consequence of this view is that Judges are always creating new law rather than applying it, and in the process they are, strictly speaking, never wrong or make a mistake. Additionally, previous court decisions aren't binding. Overall this leads to a very odd situation.

Legal realism would lead the conclusion that the process of judicial deliberation would be lawyers trying to appeal to the judge that deciding for their side would be a good outcome for them or a socially beneficial result rather than appeals to law and written word. This conclusion is a horrible miss prediction of how we see judicial decision making play out or the entire legal system is a giant conspiracy and judges, lawyers, and everyone involved are just putting on a show.

## Hart's Agreement

Hart believes that while the theory of law that Legal Realists propose is wildly implausible, he believes that they pointed out a correct and important part of the nature of judicial decision making: the unavailability of hard cases. Hart says that there will be some cases that wont straightforwardly fall under the law, and in those instances, legal realism makes sense. However, he notes that most cases are not hard cases which he calls "Easy Cases".

Hart lands on a line of logic about the nature of hard cases and their implications for courts:

1. The Law is consisted of exclusively legal rules based on general terms
2. All general terms are 'open textured'. A term will have a core based on settled meanings, but also a 'penumbra' where the meaning is indeterminate 
3. Controversial/Hard cases (which are determined by disagreement between reasonable people with legal training) fall within the penumbra of the general terms used with existing rules.
4. Since the meaning of terms in their penumbra is indeterminate, hard cases are legally indeterminate
5. Therefore, since hard cases are legally indeterminate, they cannot be determined on legal grounds and must instead be decided based on 'extra-legal' factors (morals, politics, etc.)
6. Hence, in hard cases the courts excercise "judicial discretion" and a quasi-legislative function rather than directly applying the law
