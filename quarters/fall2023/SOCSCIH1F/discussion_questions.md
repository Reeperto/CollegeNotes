Alternatively, could this just be a case in a shift of internal attitudes about who is the "official" in the society?

Our discussion has so far been about the process of honing in as simple a model of law that encapsulates complex behavior and represents real law. What exactly is the benefit to having a model of law like this? Is it to better understand people, society, or is it to function like a model in physics to predict behaviors

The focus has so far been about creating as simple a model of law that reflects complex behavior and real legal systems, but what is the purpose of such a model? Is it functioning like a physical model with the intent to provide a framework to understand and predict behavior? Is it to
