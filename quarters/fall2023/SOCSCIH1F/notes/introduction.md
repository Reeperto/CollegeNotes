# Analytic Jurisprudence
    - The development of the conceptions of law, legal interpretation, and general judical decision making

## John Austin (The Province of Jurisprudence Determined)
- **Legal Positivism** => The seperation of laws and morals
    - Austin specifically believes in the *The Command Theory of Law* where law is simply a command of the sovereign
    - A command in this sense is a wish from one intelligent to another such that the commanded act or not act in some manner. Importantly though, the commander is also willing and capable of inflicting a sanction for not complying.
