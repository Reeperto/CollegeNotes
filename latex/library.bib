As the United States celebrates the nation's "triumph over race" with the election of Barack Obama, the majority of young black men in major American cities are locked behind bars or have been labeled felons for life. Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status - much like their grandparents before them. In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community - and all of us - to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America},

In fact, they are the infinitesimal versions of the subtraction and addition operations on numbers, respectively. In the period from 1967 till 1970 Michael Grossman and Robert Katz gave definitions of a new kind of derivative and integral, moving the roles of subtraction and addition to division and multiplication, and thus established a new calculus, called multiplicative calculus. In the present paper our aim is to bring up this calculus to the attention of researchers and demonstrate its usefulness.},

  abstract = {Computer games are one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving media of our time. Revenues from console and computer games have now overtaken those from Hollywood movies; and online gaming is one of the fastest-growing areas of the internet. Games are no longer just kids' stuff: the majority of players are now adults, and the market is constantly broadening. The visual style of games has become increasingly sophisticated, and the complexities of game-play are ever more challenging. Meanwhile, the iconography and generic forms of games are increasingly influencing a whole range of other media, from films and television to books and toys. This book provides a systematic, comprehensive introduction to the analysis of computer and video games. It introduces key concepts and approaches drawn from literary, film and media theory in an accessible and concrete manner; and it tests their use and relevance by applying them to a small but representative selection of role-playing and action-adventure games. It combines methods of textual analysis and audience research, showing how the combination of such methods can give a more complete picture of these playable texts and the fan cultures they generate. Clearly written and engaging, it will be a key text for students in the field and for all those with an interest in taking games seriously.},

The resulting search method can be applied to both structured and unstructured volume datasets, and it can be applied incrementally to exploit coherence between isosurfaces.

This book is a complete guide to the current state of the subject with early chapters providing a self-contained introduction to geometric algebra. Topics covered include new techniques for handling rotations in arbitrary dimensions, and the links between rotations, bivectors and the structure of the Lie groups. Following chapters extend the concept of a complex analytic function theory to arbitrary dimensions, with applications in quantum theory and electromagnetism. Later chapters cover advanced topics such as non-Euclidean geometry, quantum entanglement, and gauge theories. Applications such as black holes and cosmic strings are also explored. It can be used as a graduate text for courses on the physical applications of geometric algebra and is also suitable for researchers working in the fields of relativity and quantum theory.},

Specifically, these games contain interstitial diegetic spaces, and empower the player to move through ‘cracks’ in the façade of the fictional world by acting as a metaphorical programmer, manipulating game files and other extradiegetic components. The metaleptic processes enabled by these actions expose aspects of the respective storyworlds which have been deliberately concealed. Consequently, the games in question literalize existing theories regarding our projection and cognitive exploration of fictional worlds, as they are singular in their capacity for experimentation and transgression of established ontological frameworks.},

Like civilization, play requires structure and participants willing to create within limits. Starting with Plato, Huizinga traces the contribution of~Homo Ludens, or “man the player” through Medieval Times, the Renaissance, and into our modern civilization. Huizinga defines play against a rich theoretical background, using cross-cultural examples from the humanities, business, and politics.~Homo Ludens~defines play for generations to come.},

This course exploits infinitesimals to introduce all the basic concepts of the calculus, mainly following Keisler’s textbook. The other is the graduate course 88826 that has been taught to between 5 and 10 graduate students yearly for the past several years.

In order to compress the mesh geometry information, we generate a fixed spectral basis using the dual graph derived from the mesh topology. After we partition a 3-D mesh model into several independent submeshes to reduce coding complexity, each submesh geometry is projected onto the generated orthonormal basis for the spectral coding. We encode two initial vertices and the dual graph information of the mesh geometry and prove the reversibility between the dual graph and the mesh geometry. The proposed scheme overcomes difficulty of generating a fixed spectral basis, and it provides multi-resolution representation of 3-D mesh models.},

The game depicts a myriad of cultures during the player’s journey from Minnesota to California amidst the impact of land allotment in the 1890s. Initiated by the Indian Land Tenure Foundation, the game was developed in collaboration with the Games for Entertainment and Learning Lab at Michigan State University thanks to support from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians and the many Indigenous creatives who contributed design, art, music, and writing. Uniquely, When Rivers Were Trails is a sovereign game, meaning that it was directed and informed by Indigenous creatives who maintained the role of final decisions during development. Merging design research and close reading methods, this study sets out to describe the game’s design, development process in regards to the game writing, and the resulting themes which emerged as a result of engaging Indigenous writers in self-determined representations.},

Our method samples the function dual to minimal edges, faces, and cells, and we show how to position those samples to reconstruct sharp and thin features of the surface. Moreover, we describe an error metric designed to guide octree expansion such that flat regions of the function are tiled with fewer polygons than curved regions to create an adaptive polygonalization of the isosurface. We then show how to improve the quality of the triangulation by moving dual vertices to the isosurface and provide a topological test that guarantees we maintain the topology of the surface. While we describe our algorithm in terms of extracting surfaces from volumetric functions, we also show that our algorithm extends to generating manifold level sets of co-dimension 1 of functions of arbitrary dimension.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the effect of ethical-and unethical-actions of the player on their perception of the self towards game characters within Toby Fox's (2015) independent Role Playing Game (RPG) Undertale, a game often perceived as a pacifist text. With a focus on the notions of guilt and responsibility in mind, a survey with 560 participants from the Undertale fandom was conducted, and thousands of YouTube comments were scraped to better understand how the audience who watched or played the different routes of the game, refer to its characters. Through the joint analysis of the game's semiotics, survey data, and data scraping, this paper argues that, beyond the rhetorical nature of its story, Undertale is operating a deconstruction of the RPG genre and is harnessing the emotional power of gameplay to evoke thoughts about responsibility and raise the player's awareness about violence and its consequences.},

  abstract = {A new type of calculus called "multiplicative calculus" is developed and some basic theorems about derivatives, integrals, and infinite products are proved within this calculus. Multiplicative calculus is based on a multiplicative mechanism in the same sense that the usual calculus is based on an additive mechanism. One consequence is that, just as the usual derivative of a linear function is constant, the multiplicative derivative of an exponential function is constant (and just as the usual derivative of a constant function is 0, the multiplicative derivative of a constant function is 1). Similarly, just as two functions that have a constant difference have the same usual derivative, two functions that have a constant ratio have the same multiplicative derivative. Finally, just as many functions have infinite series representations based on the usual derivative, the same functions have infinite product representations based on the multiplicative derivative. These in turn are derived from exponential approximations to functions that are analogous to the linear approximations of the usual calculus. Multiplicative calculus is a useful supplement to the usual calculus in that it is tailored to situations involving exponential functions in the same sense that the usual calculus is tailored to situations involving linear functions.},

Combining conclusions from media effects research informed by the communication effects literature with those from ethnographic research informed by a sociocultural perspective on cognition and learning, we present a shared theoretical framework for understanding (a) the extent to which such virtual worlds are structurally similar to "third places" (Oldenburg, 1999) for informal sociability, and (b) their potential function in terms of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 2000). Our conclusion is that by providing spaces for social interaction and relationships beyond the workplace and home, MMOs have the capacity to function as one form of a new "third place" for informal sociability. Participation in such virtual "third places" appears particularly well suited to the formation of bridging social capital—social relationships that, while not usually providing deep emotional support, typically function to expose the individual to a diversity of worldviews.},

  abstract = {The dual of a 2-manifold polygonal mesh without boundary is commonly defined as another mesh with the same topology (genus) but different connectivity (vertex–face incidence), in which faces and vertices occupy complementary locations and the position of each dual vertex is computed as the center of mass (barycenter or centroid) of the vertices that support the corresponding face. This barycenter dual mesh operator is connectivity idempotent but not geometrically idempotent for any choice of vertex positions, other than constants. In this paper we construct a new resampling dual mesh operator that is geometrically idempotent for the largest possible linear subspace of vertex positions. We look at the primal and dual mesh connectivities as irregular sampling spaces and at the rules to determine dual vertex positions as the result of a resampling process that minimizes signal loss. Our formulation, motivated by the duality of Platonic solids, requires the solution of a simple least-squares problem. We introduce a simple and efficient iterative algorithm closely related to Laplacian smoothing and with the same computational cost. We also characterize the configurations of vertex positions where signal loss does and does not occur during dual mesh resampling and the asymptotic behavior of iterative dual mesh resampling in the general case. Finally, we describe the close relation existing with discrete fairing and variational subdivision, and define a new primal–dual interpolatory recursive subdivision scheme.},

  abstract = {How a form of play becomes a sport: players, agents, referees, leagues, tournaments, sponsorships, and spectators, and the culture of professional computer game play.Competitive video and computer game play is nothing new: the documentary King of Kong memorably portrays a Donkey Kong player's attempts to achieve the all-time highest score; the television show Starcade (1982–1984) featured competitions among arcade game players; and first-person shooter games of the 1990s became multiplayer through network play. A new development in the world of digital gaming, however, is the emergence of professional computer game play, complete with star players, team owners, tournaments, sponsorships, and spectators. In Raising the Stakes, T. L. Taylor explores the emerging scene of professional computer gaming and the accompanying efforts to make a sport out of this form of play.In the course of her explorations, Taylor travels to tournaments, including the World Cyber Games Grand Finals (which considers itself the computer gaming equivalent of the Olympics), and interviews participants from players to broadcasters. She examines pro-gaming, with its highly paid players, play-by-play broadcasts, and mass audience; discusses whether or not e-sports should even be considered sports; traces the player's path from amateur to professional (and how a hobby becomes work); and describes the importance of leagues, teams, owners, organizers, referees, sponsors, and fans in shaping the structure and culture of pro-gaming.Taylor connects professional computer gaming to broader issues: our notions of play, work, and sport; the nature of spectatorship; the influence of money on sports. And she examines the ongoing struggle over the gendered construction of play through the lens of male-dominated pro-gaming. Ultimately, the evolution of professional computer gaming illuminates the contemporary struggle to convert playful passions into serious play.},

  abstract = {Classic and cutting-edge writings on games, spanning nearly 50 years of game analysis and criticism, by game designers, game journalists, game fans, folklorists, sociologists, and media theorists.The Game Design Reader is a one-of-a-kind collection on game design and criticism, from classic scholarly essays to cutting-edge case studies. A companion work to Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman's textbook Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, The Game Design Reader is a classroom sourcebook, a reference for working game developers, and a great read for game fans and players.Thirty-two essays by game designers, game critics, game fans, philosophers, anthropologists, media theorists, and others consider fundamental questions: What are games and how are they designed? How do games interact with culture at large? What critical approaches can game designers take to create game stories, game spaces, game communities, and new forms of play?Salen and Zimmerman have collected seminal writings that span 50 years to offer a stunning array of perspectives. Game journalists express the rhythms of game play, sociologists tackle topics such as role-playing in vast virtual worlds, players rant and rave, and game designers describe the sweat and tears of bringing a game to market. Each text acts as a springboard for discussion, a potential class assignment, and a source of inspiration. The book is organized around fourteen topics, from The Player Experience to The Game Design Process, from Games and Narrative to Cultural Representation. Each topic, introduced with a short essay by Salen and Zimmerman, covers ideas and research fundamental to the study of games, and points to relevant texts within the Reader. Visual essays between book sections act as counterpoint to the writings. Like Rules of Play, The Game Design Reader is an intelligent and playful book. An invaluable resource for professionals and a unique introduction for those new to the field, The Game Design Reader is essential reading for anyone who takes games seriously.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the eigenfunctions of the edge-based Laplacian on a graph and the relationship of these functions to random walks on the graph. We commence by discussing the set of eigenfunctions supported at the vertices, and demonstrate the relationship of these eigenfunctions to the classical random walk on the graph. Then, from an analysis of functions supported only on the interior of edges, we develop a method for explicitly calculating the edge-interior eigenfunctions of the edge-based Laplacian. This reveals a connection between the edge-based Laplacian and the adjacency matrix of backtrackless random walk on the graph. The edge-based eigenfunctions therefore correspond to some eigenfunctions of the normalized Hashimoto matrix.},

In the current study, a factor analytic approach was used to create an empirical model of player motivations. The analysis revealed 10 motivation subcomponents that grouped into 3 overarching components (Achievement, Social, and Immersion). Relationships between motivations and demographic variables (age, gender, and usage patterns) are also presented.},
