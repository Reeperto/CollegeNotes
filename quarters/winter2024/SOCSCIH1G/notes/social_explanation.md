title: Explanation in the Social Sciences

There are two main factors that come up when discussing social science outcomes that get attention:

1. Individuals (agency, choices, actions, etc.)
    - Viewed as lower-level / micro-factor
    - "Individualistic explanations"
2. Social Structures (public policy, economic systems, social hierarchies, etc.)
    - Viewed as higher-level / macro-factor
    - Structural explanations

Individuals are often playing a large role in social science explanations. However, social structure has been harder to show as an explanatory device (they are "mysterious"). Social structure is harder to understand because

- They are harder to "see". They are less physical
- They are hard to define
- If causality is a connected process, then social structures are extremely difficult to pin down what is the physical connection and especially what "mark" is transmitted

# The Trouble with Stories (Charles Tilly)

Stories to Tilly are a sequential, explanatory, recounting of connected, self-propelled people and events. *Standard stories* are sequential, explanatory accounts of self-motivated human action. Why do these stories matter?

- Explanations are stories

## Standard Stories

- Standard stories are often preferred by humans when packing information in memory
- Sociologists however give explanations of social inequality that result from indirect, unintended, collective, and environmentally mediated effects and therefore fit badly with standard stories

The main problem with standard stories in sociology is they **highlight cause and effect relationships centered on actors' deliberated actions**. They appeal to individuals and fail to properly account for external or higher level causes that are definitely present in sociology.

There are then in general 3 main problems for the standard story model when trying to explain social effects

- Collective actions (classes, nations)
- Abstract causal forces (mentalities, cultures, technologies, forms of power)
- "Non-story" structures (markets, networks, capital, goods, labor, etc.)

One could argue that social explanations don't exist. However there are cases where it does appear that social structure explains.

1. In the US, children from low-income housing often are in crowded housing with dust mites and cockroaches. These causes asthma attacks and contribute to keeping poorer children out of school or hamper their academic performance
    - The standard story model doesn't fit this well since things like "low income crowded housing" are abstract

2. Jason and the City Bus
