# What, according to Hart, distinguishes rules from mere habits? (pp. 55-6)

Rules differ from habits in three ways:

1. Rules, when deviated from, have grounds for criticism and social pressures to conform
2. Criticism and pressure that results from deviation is seen as legitamate and/or justified
3. A Rule has both an external and internal aspect. People who follow rules have internally an attitude towrads the pattern of behavior.

# What is the difference between the internal and the external point of view? (pp. 56-7, pp. 88-90) 

The external point of view of rules is the assertions made by observers of conduct and the internal point of view is the assertion of a member of a group that they accept a rule and will use it as a guide for their conduct.
