The poem follows the writer's time running poetry workshops at a prison with young boy inmates and in doing so reveals the omnipresent and apathetic force that is the US penitentiary system over young people. The prison for the young boy's the writer discusses is their beginning and end as seen by the statement "Every sentence ended with \ The word prison \ Every prison began before \ The sentencing". Life for these boys was a prison before they were even sentenced to go, and life for them after would always end with the prison. Even outside the prison, the boys would still not be free as the government would soon start using ankle bracelets as constant surveillance, further emphasizing the omnipresence of the prison in these boy's lives. The ankle bracelets dehumanizes its wearer, turning young boys and men into "Wild animals". The prison environment provides no life or emotion with heavily gray and bleak environment. The room had a "stainless steel \ Lunch table" and everyone wore "Gray \ Cotton sweatpants" with "Gray \ Sweaters". Something of a more unrelated note, the poem's use of space is very intriguing as it appears to bounce back and forth off the edges of the paper. The poem discusses how when Julian was released that he wasn't actually free but instead "the boundaries of his cage" had been rearranged. The edges of the page serve as a cage, confining the text to forever bounce back and forth between confined edges.
