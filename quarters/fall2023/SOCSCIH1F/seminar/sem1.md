# Understanding Hart's Objections: Scope of Laws

> The orders backed by threats is essentially the expression of a win that others should do or abstain from doing certain things. It is, of course, possible that legislation might take this exclusively other-regarding formâ€¦ But the range of application of a law is always a question of its interpretation. It may or may not be found on interpretation to exclude those who made it, and, of course, many a law is now made which imposes legal obligations on the makers of the law. Legislation, as distinct from just ordering others to do things under threats, may perfectly well have such a self-binding force. There is nothing essentially other-regarding about it. (p. 42)
