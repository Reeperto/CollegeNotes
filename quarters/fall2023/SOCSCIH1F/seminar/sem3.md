# Warm-Up

1. What, according to Dworkin, are "propositions of law?" What are "grounds of law?" (p. 4)

2. What, for Dworkin, is empirical disagreement about the law? What is theoretical disagreement about the law? (p. 4-5)

3. What is the so-called "plain-fact view" about the law? (pp. 6-7)
    - The plain fact view is the claim that theoretical disagreement does not exist in the form that people disagree about the grounds of law
    - Claims that what appears to be theoretical disagreement in practice is actually just an illusion


# Propositions and Grounds of Law

- Proposition of Law
    - A statement and/or claim about what the law is, does, entitles, etc.
- Grounds of Law
    - What "things" imply the truth of other propositions of law?
    - Theoretical disagreement is based around disagreement over the grounds of law

# Empirical vs Theoretical Disagreement

- Theoretical Disagreement
    - A disagreement about the grounds of law in a case
- Empirical Disagreement
    - A disagreement about whether the agreed upon grounds of law applys to the specific case
