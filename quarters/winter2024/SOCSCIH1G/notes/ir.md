# What is International Relations

- A sub discipline of political science
- Trying to understand and explain the relations between states in an international context
    - Cross-border movement of "stuff": people, money, goods and services, ideas, violence, norms, etc. 
    - How asymmetries of power between and among states and non-state actors that determine who gets what under what conditions

Central to international relations is to develop an accurate and useful picture of the world. This heavily relies on what makes certain views in IR "correct", which is a question of what explanations are better or worse. Therefore philosophy science can heavily inform explanation in IR to answer these questions.

# Laws in International Relations

It has been hard to find any laws (in the DN sense) that hold with some regularity in international relations.

## The Theory of Democratic Peace

The idea of the Democratic Peace is that democracies are less likely to go to war *with other democracies* than with non-democracies.

### Candidate Explanations

- Political Culture or Normative Beliefs
    - Democracies have a tradition of non violent conflict resolution
    - War is therefore unlikely between democracies since they will both employ non violent approaches to their conflicts
- Institutional Constraints
    - People who would be fighting the war have more political influence and therefore they will be conflict averse
    - Mote veto points leads to generally slow and conservative decision making
    - More legible intentions and less rick of miscalculations: overall transparency in decision making leading to more credible commitments between democracies
    - Democracies will not fear surprise attacks from other democracies (because of legible intentions) and will be less inclined to take preemptive strikes

## Supporting Evidence

- Descriptive Statistics
    - Dataset of "politically relevant dyads" (dyads being pairs of democratic states)
    - Count the frequency of different levels of dispute behavior among democratic and non-democratic dyads to find escalation probabilities
- Causal inference
    - Does the condition of a pair being democracies cause them to have more peaceful relations than if one was non-democratic, all else being equal?
    - Statistical evidence that changing this factor holding all else equal does influence the outcome of escalation

Therefore, is democratic peace a law? There are certain things to be skeptical of:

- "Democracy" is a social fact that is unstable
    - If the claim is that democracy does the causal work, then democracy must be well defined otherwise democracy could be a front for something else that is doing the explanatory work
    - Data sets may rank democracies by their similarity to the US, shifting the explanatory variables 

- Democracies may describe democracies as other states that they do not want to go to war with, and non-democracies as those that they do
