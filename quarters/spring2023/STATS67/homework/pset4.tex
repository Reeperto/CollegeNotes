\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{Part A}
Once can say with high confidence that the true mean of sleep is under 8 hours since the entire confidence interval of 95\% confidence lies under 8.

\subsection*{Part B}
The confidence interval would get narrower.

\subsection*{Part C}
The confidence interval would get wider.

\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{Part A}
It follows an approximate normal distribution.

\subsection*{Part B}
The confidence interval will be of the form $\hat{\mu} \pm t^* \cdot \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n}}$ where $\hat{\mu} = 6.32, \hat{\sigma} = 1.65, t^* = 0.95$, and $n = 50$, resulting an interval
\[
	(5.851, 6.789)
.\]

\subsection*{Part C}
We can say with 95\% confidence that the true average adaptation time for a robotic lens lies between 5.851 and 6.789 seconds.

\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{Part A}
The confidence interval will be of the form $\hat{p} \pm t^* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ where $\hat{p} = 0.55, n = 1000,$ and $t^* = 2.576$, resulting an interval
\[
	(0.5095, 0.5905)
.\]

\subsection*{Part B}
We can say with 99\% confidence that the true average proportion of all voters that will answer yes to if they support the governments foreign policy is between 0.5095 and 0.5905.
