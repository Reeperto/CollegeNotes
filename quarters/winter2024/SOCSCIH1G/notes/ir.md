# What is International Relations

- A sub discipline of political science
- Trying to understand and explain the relations between states in an international context
    - Cross-border movement of "stuff": people, money, goods and services, ideas, violence, norms, etc. 
    - How asymmetries of power between and among states and non-state actors that determine who gets what under what conditions

Central to international relations is to develop an accurate and useful picture of the world. This heavily relies on what makes certain views in IR "correct", which is a question of what explanations are better or worse. Therefore philosophy science can heavily inform explanation in IR to answer these questions.
