# Writing

## 4
The first process writing we did I think was the most useful overall for my essay as it provided the core component to my essay: how I would define the prison system. The rest of the arguments and evidence I call on in the paper serve to support that original claim meaning it was key to have had a working theory or definition. Compared to what is currently in my paper, the definition I provided in the process writing stayed almost the same as the one in my essay. This was a slightly new experience to me completing process writings as I generally do not turn to longer form factors when doing pre-writing. Before almost every essay I write I spend more time attempting to craft a single thesis statement that then guides a long form outline. I'll then find myself spending most of the pre-writing process in the outline, often producing bullet points that can be paragraphs long. Once I feel comfortable with the overall structure the essay writing becomes a game of piecing together the long form bullet points and flushing out any ideas. This time around with process writings was really interesting as without grasping entirely what my final essay or thesis would even look like, I was able to create 2 very good responses that fit right into my actual essay. In the future I probably will still stick to my pre-writing method of focusing intensly on the thesis and outline, but I will be more open to potential free-writing/process writing.

The peer revision process I think was very useful as a good checkpoint for my efforts. When we did peer review in class I hadn't completely finished a full length paper and I had a worry that I could be on the wrong track. Even though I stood by most of my arguments or analysis, I didn't want to be blindsighted by something obvious I had missed. It was therefore very reassuring to receive constructive feedback that served to enhance what I had rather than to go back and fully redo or restructure the paper. I additionally received good advice on better evidence commentary that was very important to my revisions that I did. I think the peer review reflection was useful as the question of "What suggestions will you ignore and why?" caught me off guard slightly since I feel often I can fall into a hole of making changes to fit any suggestions. It made me really reflect on what suggestions I got and to properly evaluate their impact and to pick and choose from there.

# Research

Through my research process, my opinions regarding prison abolition have not changed but have rather become more nuanced and my belief in prison abolition has become stronger. While reading Golden Gulag, I was constantly shocked to learn about the extent of economic exploitation that occurs within the prison system. Prior to taking this class, I was familiar with some arguments for prison abolition and believed that the prison system needed to be dismantled, but I had not fully understood the economic implications of the prison-industrial complex. The economic exploitation that occurs within the prison system is pervasive and deeply troubling. Prisons rely on the labor of incarcerated individuals to function, yet they pay them next to nothing or nothing at all. This means that the labor of incarcerated individuals is being exploited for profit, which raises serious ethical questions about the nature of work and the exploitation of vulnerable populations. Additionally, the private companies that operate within the prison system profit from the incarceration of individuals, which creates a financial incentive for the perpetuation of mass incarceration. My research has provided me with a deeper understanding of the political, social, and economic consequences of the prison-industrial complex. This understanding has only strengthened my belief in the need for prison abolition. I am now able to confidently articulate my beliefs and advocate for the abolition of the prison system with a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand.

The best method I have found for organizing and keeping track of notes and sources is to turn to resource database managing software (in my case Zotero). Almost all of these types of software offer a browser extension that allows instant importing of sources into the database along with all the required meta data and citation information. Additionally, I have coded my own manager that allows me to view, annotate, or get a citation for any source in my database manager. This makes writing my essays much easier as with a single key shortcut in any text editor I can view an entire project's sources and not have to worry about locating them or digging through bookmarks. Additionally, the software auto manages my bibliography meaning I can just focus on actual content and never fight a style guide for my citations or works cited.
