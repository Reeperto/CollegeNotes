- Characters are living within the same place but at different times
- Paris time is value more over than personal time
- Invisible city that lives at the intersection of time zones

# Shiang-chyi

- Unable to connect with the people in France
	- The only potential connection she could develop was with a Hong Kong girl
	- Even attempts to connect with someone who could better understand her still failed, with the moment of her trying to engage and leaving feeling like an empty action



# Synchronicity

- Moment of Despair
	- Each character finds themselves together in time most alone
	- For each character, they turn to sexual pleasure to alieve their loneliness
		- Shiang-chyi tries to have sex with a Hong Kong girl she had met earlier
		- Hsiao-kang has sex with a prostitute who ends up stealing his case of watches
		- Hsiao-Kang's mother masturbates to the thought of her dead husband
	- The action of the scene is rather the inaction. The lack of intimacy serves as a climax for the film, putting onto display a moment of greatess disconnection for each character.
	- The moment serves as a turning point for Hsiao-Kong. He is now able to empathize with what his mother is experiencing


# Ending Shot

- Hsiao-Kang's father reappers, walking in the distance towards a Ferris Wheel that rotates counter-clockwise
	- Clock Interpretation: The Ferris Wheel's rotation backwards implies that time is volatile: able to weave back and forth


# Big Questions

- Is this film an abstract built around the idea of time, or is there a present affect (a sense of emotion that has no real label)?
