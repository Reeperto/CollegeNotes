# Fernando
Fernando's essay was a hybrid between a letter to his family and a more academic paper, tapping into his Filipino heritage and discussing parallelisms between the politics of the Philippines and the American prison system, successfully motivating the importance of why one should care about prison abolition. His arguments were strong with consistently supported claims. The following changes would I think potentially make this good essay clearer

- Directness in transitions: transition words like “firstly” to open up a paragraph often can be changed or cut to produce a more direct flow.
    - Headers: The headers do provide a good road map to the structure of the essay. I also believe the transitions if treated more directly could remove the need for headings, making the letter flow continuously in its arguments. Hence I think headings aren't exactly necessary but that is a stylistic choice more than anything.

- The thesis statement could probably be placed earlier in the essay, or potentially a “prototype” thesis that matures and develops over the course of the introduction that then is fully fleshed out and stated at the end of the intro.

# Andy
Andy's essay was an academic paper that focused on how the prison system of America is deeply rooted in the racism and oppressive history of slavery with those in power (capitalists, white supremacists, and bureaucrats) with the prison acting as a system that only serves to forcefully remove those from society that go against societies "status quo". Andy continually integrated quotes and evidence into his claims in a way that read very clearly and concisely. My recommendations for him is to flush out the paper by completing and similar strong analysis of another author and to search for just a few more sources to potentially highlight the strongest or most damning arguments and claims.

# Reflection
My current draft arguably only contains a guiding thesis and one flushed out section of a single author's arguments. Therefore I intend to first and foremost develop the arguments of another one of the writer's of interest and play their ideas off one another. Additionally I will provide a better contextualization of the "why" behind prison abolition for me personally and for why objectively it needs to be addressed. There are no changes or suggestions I was offered that I disagree with, so I intend to include or attempt to include all the ideas I was offered.
