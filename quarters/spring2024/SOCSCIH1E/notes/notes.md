# Utility Revisited

A core assumption of modern decision theory is that

\begin{center}
    rational agents **maximize utility**
\end{center}

This is a very descriptive account of people's wants and preferences. That is, it is characterizing the way we value our wants, not prescribing what one ought to want. Utility functions appear inadequate to capture all preferences, and there are preferences we have that we feel are wrong. This requires having a normative aspect.

## Normativity in Wants

What *should* we want, and *why*?

- It is ethically or morally required
- God has dictated it so
- Will lead to obtaining a want
- The want has intrinsic or objective value

# Buddhism

- Arose from ascetic or *sramanic* positions
- Typical feature were wondering monks or holy people
    - Would renounce worldly goods, meditate, and seek wisdom
    - Contrasts with the Brahmanic Hindu tradition and involved rejecting the Veta's authority

## Asceticism

- Commonly involved the rejection of the worldly
- Key idea was to focus entirely on one's spirituality

# Stoicism

- Founded by Zeno of Citium
- Adopted many of the Cynic's ethical ideas
    - Emphasis on the peace of mind from living simply
- Morally neutral things need not be renounced unlike the Cynics claim

## Epictetus

- Epictetus was a late Stoic philosopher
    - His students compiled Enchiridion
    - 52 instructions for living a good life

## How to live according to Epictetus

- One is only in control of their own actions, and all else is to be considered as nothing
    - Provides full control over one's internal state
